The MIT license covers everything as far as usage goes (tl;dr use it wherever, whenever, however, feel free to modify, but just make sure to include that license if you fork or mod it)

# Avatar Usage
Use freely. If anyone asks, just mention my name, "Xan" (said "zan", much like the drug, but not actually based off of the drug, I had the name way before it was popular :c). I didn't make this and post it open source for everyone to see so that I could say you can't use it, after all!
